<p><a NAME="GettingStarted"></a>FIRST THINGS FIRST</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica">

<p>More than likely you are thinking of starting a Dignity chapter because you feel some
need for opportunities to have regular contact with gay and lesbian Catholics whose faith
is an important part of their lives. Many gay and lesbian people feel that some contact
with the Catholic Church is important, but they feel alienated in some way from the local
church. Perhaps they need a safe place where they can find accepting and affirming
ministry, which they cannot find elsewhere. Your group could be instrumental in fulfilling
their needs as well as your own by beginning a chapter.</p>

<p>You may wonder why you should form a Dignity chapter instead of just any group. There
are many advantages to being a Dignity chapter, not the least of which is the DIGNITY name
itself. Our organization is well known in gay/lesbian and Catholic Church communities and
can provide you with an immediate identity in your locale. In addition, you can receive
support for your efforts through contact with the National Director in your region and the
Regional Coordinator in your area and nearby chapters and through attendance at Regional
and National meetings. Being a part of a larger family is important for the leaders of
smaller, more isolated groups who find refreshment and energy from meeting their sisters
and brothers in Dignity. All members of your chapter would also profit by receiving our
excellent National Journal and having connection with other like-minded people throughout
the country. Being members of Dignity can make them feel part of a larger endeavor that
can have a greater impact on the Church and on peoples' lives than any other local group
can have by itself.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are sure now that the kind of group you want to start would be useful and
that a connection with Dignity would be desirable. You may wonder where to start. No doubt
you have a few friends who feel the way you do and might be happy to begin a chapter. Find
a place for your first meeting, get out the news by word of mouth and do some publicity.
(Helpful hints on publicity and advertising follow). At one of your first meetings,
discuss Dignity's <u>Statement of Position and Purpose</u>. This is a statement which many
groups have found useful in giving their activities direction and purpose. It will also
help focus discussion on the direction your new group should take.</p>

<p>One thing cannot be stressed too much. If you wish to do effective ministry, you must
be welcoming and inclusive of all people who cane to your group. The best way to make
everyone feel welcome is to get a good mix of people at your first meeting so that you
have a variety of input. People of color will feel welcome if there are other people of
color present. Women will feel a part of the group if other women are present. Don't
depend on your own friends and acquaintances for those first few meetings. Make every
outreach possible to see that you have a good mix from the very start. You will no doubt
also find that people who are not Catholics may wish to be a part of the group; let them
know that they are most welcome too. We are, after all, an organization of gay and lesbian
Catholics and our friends!</p>

<p>You will need to make some decisions very quickly. Temporary officers will need to be
chosen and you will need to obtain an address for the group (a post office box is usually
best) and a telephone contact. Then you will need to appoint someone to plan liturgies, to
do news releases to the local media and someone to open a bank account for chapter funds.
For the protection of all concerned, we strongly recommend that you have a two signature
account. By contacting your National Director you can obtain a supply of National
Journals, Regional newsletters and membership applications. While it is not necessary to
do all these things at your first few meetings, the sooner you do them, the quicker your
Dignity chapter will be off to a good beginning</p>

<p>You will need to decide what type of activities to have at your meetings. Dignity has a
strong religious focus so you may want to have some type of liturgy or prayer at some of
your meetings. (Suggestions on Liturgy follow) You will want to have social activities and
educational programs especially in smaller communities. Group discussion are also
excellent ways of helping people to get to know one another. They are inexpensive and easy
to organize compared with other activities. Some topics might include: '<sup>1</sup>Coming
Out,&quot; &quot;Experiences in the Church,&quot; &quot;What my Faith means tome,&quot;
&quot;Problems in the Workplace,&quot; &quot;Relationships with others&quot; and
&quot;Sexual Ethics.&quot; Give everyone an opportunity to speak without having any one
person dominate the conversation.</p>

<p>You might consider inviting people from other organizations to come speak to you group
about a certain issue. Lesbian/gay political groups are quite willing to do so on
occasion. You might also screen movies, which may be of interest to the group such as
major releases with gay/lesbian themes, educational tapes and the like. Activities
involving the outdoors are usually fun such as hikes, picnics, a day at the beach or
mountains, a group trip to a football or baseball game or maybe a backyard barbecue at a
member's home.</p>

<p>We suggest that you make contact with your neighboring chapters, become involved in
Regional and Sub-regional activities whenever possible and work toward achieving full
chapter status as soon as possible. The length of time to achieve full status will vary
from region to region. In order to become a chartered chapter it will be necessary to have
ten (10) dues paying members in your chapter and have bylaws which are approved by your
chapter's members. Those bylaws should not be conflict with the <u>Dignity STATEMENT OF
POSITION AND PURPOSE</u> nor Dignity 's national policies. When your National Director
concurs that your group is ready for full chapter status, s/he will request a charter be
granted at the next Dignity/USA board meeting.</p>

<p>We welcome you to the Dignity/USA family! We hope that these first few months of
working toward full chapter status will be exciting and that your efforts will bear much
fruit.</p>

<p>Good luck and remember God loves you more that you will ever know. May God be with us
all.</p>

<p>The basic unit of Dignity is the chapter. In order for Dignity to succeed, the
individual chapters must be healthy, active and growing. In according with the bylaws of
Dignity/USA, to be a chartered chapter of Dignity/USA, a chapter must have a minimum of
ten (10) dues paying members, have existed continuously for at least six months, and have
the recommendation of the National Director. Once the charter is granted the required
number of members to maintain active status is not specified.</p>

<p>There are Dignity chapters in the United States and Dignity chapters in Canada. The
chapters in Canada are part of Dignity/Canada/Dignite, Both Dignity/USA and
Dignity/Canada/Dignite had their beginnings in San Diego &amp; Los Angeles in 1969. By
resolution of the House of Delegates in 1985, Dignity/Canada/Dignite became a separate
organization from Dignity/USA. Through our International Liaison, Dignity/USA maintains
contact with Dignity/Canada/Dignite and other lesbian/gay Catholic groups in France,
England and Australia. Many states in the USA do not yet have a Dignity chapter. A current
list of chapters of Dignity/USA is included in this manual.</p>

<p>Each region has a House of Delegates. The Regional House conducts the business of the
region, and advises the National Director. In most regions, the Regional House plans
regional {meetings and conferences and organizes other regional activities. The Regional
House is composed of at least one delegate from each chapter in the region, and sees to
its own finances. A portion of each member's dues (from the region) helps to finance the
expenses of the Regional House.</p>

<p>The National Director is elected by the Regional House and has duties and
responsibilities assigned by the Dignity/USA bylaws and the bylaws of that region. The
Regional House of Delegates also elects one or more Regional Coordinators as needed to
conduct the business of the region. The Regional Coordinators are responsible for the
administration of regional business, for regional finances and responsible to the
delegates for their performance. The National Director is responsible to the Regional
Delegates for his/her performance on Dignity/USA's Board of Directors. In many regions,
some of these duties are delegated to other officers of the region. A region may have a
treasurer, secretary, newsletter editor or administrator, as indicated by the regional
bylaws. One of the most important functions of the National Director is supervision and
assistance to chapters-in-formation. In order for any chapter to receive a charter, the
Director must recommend it. The director will also propose the revocation of a chapter<sup>1</sup>s
charter when the chapter is no longer active (e.g. has dropped to zero membership), when
the chapter requests revocation of the charter, or for cause, which is outlined
specifically in the bylaws of Dignity/USA.</p>

<p>The National Board of Directors consists of the National Director from each of the
seven regions and the National CWC Representative and the four officers of Dignity/USA.
The Dignity/USA bylaws also provide for the election of three additional members of the
board, as determined by the board to ensure diversity and continuity on the board.</p>

<p>The Board is responsible for the finances of Dignity/USA, for implementing
&quot;interim&quot; policies of the organization and administering the policies of the
House of Delegates. The officers of Dignity/USA are responsible for the day-today
operation of the organization.</p>

<p>The House of Delegates of Dignity/USA is composed of delegates from all the chapters.
The representation of the chapters is proportional as outlined in the USA bylaws. The
House of Delegates meets every two years immediately prior to the Dignity/USA convention.</p>

<p>According to the bylaws of Dignity/USA, each chapter is entitled to at least one
delegate. In addition, any chapter having more than 25 members on its official enrollment
roster, as registered with the Secretary shall be entitled to additional delegates. As a
rule, voting on issues takes place only at meetings of the House of Delegates. There have
been votes on major topics between session of the House in which the votes were taken by
mail.</p>

<p>The sample bylaws, included with this package, recommend certain officers for each
chapter. These officers are only suggested. It is recommended, however, that the main
leaders of your chapter become the delegates to the region and to the Dignity/USA
convention.</p>

<p>The officers of Dignity/USA are President, Vice-President, Secretary and Treasurer. The
House of Delegates elects the President and Vice-President for a two-year term during
their biennial session, which occurs immediately before a Dignity/USA convention. The
National Board of Directors elects the Secretary and Treasurer upon recommendation from
the new President and Vice President of Dignity/USA. Gender parity must be maintained
between the two top offices, that is, the offices of President and Vice-President must be
held by one woman and one man. There is no provision in the bylaws of Dignity/USA
concerning the number of terms officers <i>may </i>serve. Therefore, if the House of
Delegates wishes, it may repeatedly elect the same slate of officers.</p>

<p>The officers conduct the day-to-day business of the organization, and serve as its
corporate officers. Dignity/USA is a registered non-profit corporation in the District of
Columbia. The President of Dignity/USA is also the official spokesperson for the
organization. No one else is authorized to speak for Dignity/USA unless s/he has been so
designated.</p>

<p><a NAME="Liturgies"></a>LITURGIES</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica">

<p>Spirituality is one of the hallmarks of Dignity/USA and its chapters. Most chapters do
sponsor same type of liturgical function either at all of their gatherings or on a regular
basis.</p>

<p>if you've never planned a liturgy before, the concept may be a bit frightening to you
at first. Remember, &quot;liturgy&quot; means &quot;the work of the people.&quot; That
means there can be as many kinds of liturgy as there are groups that gather together to
worship. While many Dignity chapters celebrate Mass regularly, other types of liturgy are
alternated with Mass and have become to many chapters, the principle form of worship. Many
Catholic communities are exploring various kinds of prayer and celebration, which enrich
the spiritual lives of the community. What is important is that the spiritual and
liturgical life of the chapter meets the needs of the chapter's membership. This means not
only that they are ministered to, but that they have the opportunity to minister to the
community also.</p>

<p>There are many excellent resources to help in your planning. Visit any religious
bookstore of any denomination and sample the material that is available. In addition to
printed materials, you might also want to identify people in your community who can help.
In many parishes, colleges and religious communities<sub>1</sub> priests, sisters,
brothers and lay people who regularly plan liturgies will be able to offer support and
advice. They can also help you identify people who would preside at your liturgies, or
train your own members to do so</p>

<p>When planning liturgy, keep in mind that Dignity was never intended to replace
membership in the local parish. But know that for many of your members, Dignity will
replace the parish and for each person, this as a very personal choice.</p>

<p>Do all that you can to gather your chapter together in prayer and celebration<sub>1</sub>
social events, projects, etc. Do all that you can to allow a vital faith communty of
justice seeking friends to develop. The intimacy of your chapter will be evident in your
liturgies. Chapters whose members know and care for one another prays together often and
well.</p>

<p>For more help and ideas concerning liturgy and the formation of a faith community,
contact your Regional Coordinator or National Director. S/he will help you and will also
put you in touch with other individuals who can help you also.</p>

<p><a NAME="Fundraising"></a>FUNDRAISING</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica">

<p>Every Dignity chapter is in need of additional funding and the best <i>way </i>to see
that there is adequate money to meet the chapter's needs and goals is through fundraising.
There are many ways to do this. Ultimately, the best method is to have each member give a
certain percentage of his/her income on a regular basis. Tithing is becoming a concept
more familiar to the American Catholic today. Some of your members would be willing to
tithe to the chapter if encouraged to do so. Lately parishes have focused on a
three-pronged approach of giving time, talent and treasures. In this way the donor is
challenged to give of his/her full person, not just what is surplus. The following are
other ideas to use for the raising of funds for the chapter:</p>

<p>* 50-50 raffle (probably the easiest to do and one of willing to give more that they
would otherwise, if this the more lucrative, it also provides the instant reward for the
winner and the winner is part of the event as it happens)</p>

<p>* Charge for a social event, dance, speaker or party</p>

<p>* Bake sale</p>

<p>* Rummage/white elephant/yard sale</p>

<p>* Raffle tickets for a specific purpose (this usually nets you what you need and then
some, however, if you are incorporated and/or have tax-exempt status, your money is then
locked into that specific purpose and may not be used for any other purpose-auditors will
be looking for this)</p>

<p>* Fund appeal letter ( these are a little hard to do and require some overhead costs.)</p>

<p>* Conduct a time/talent series in your chapter that will increase donations and gifts
(this requires some effort, commitment, and training for the folks who will be conducting
the appeal.)</p>

<p>Finally, almost any public library in your city will have a section on volunteer
organizations. There are a number of books available on grassroots fundraising for small
organizations. Remember, the best policy is this; you have a cause you believe in it, you
are committed to it and you make it fun.</p>

<p><a NAME="Advertising"></a>ADVERTISING</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica">

<p>Most chapters of Dignity do some form of advertising, whether it be strictly by word of
mouth or by formal advertisements placed in various publications. Your chapter may decide
to do some local advertising to help get the word out that you exist, and that you are a
part of a national gay/lesbian Catholic organization.</p>

<p>Although advertising can be quite expensive sometimes it can be totally free, depending
on the resources available in your area. You may be able to get some help for paid
advertising from your Dignity region. Contact your Regional Coordinator or National
Director (listed on the attached chapter list) for information on this possibility.</p>

<p>Many regularly published newspapers have &quot;Events&quot; sections which will run a
listing of a meeting or liturgy at no cost. You must generally contact the newspaper for
requirements (how big the listing must be, types of language to be used, whether a contact
telephone number is required, etc.) Even in relatively small cities, few newspapers will
deny your request to list.</p>

<p>There are usually gay/lesbian newspapers in cities and towns having a sizable
gay/lesbian community. These papers will usually accept any &quot;News Releases&quot;
regarding the activities of your chapter. If there is no gay/lesbian press n your
community, check out the weeklies also available in your community. These papers often are
published by people interested in the arts, and are generally available free to the
public. They may charge something for publication of an ad, but usually run a news release
gratis</p>

<p>If you have a local gay/lesbian community center, be sure you are listed as a resource
on their hot line. Usually, you will only have to ask to be included, but you may wish to
become a &quot;business ~er<sup>1</sup>' of that organization in order to make your
listing as a resource more readily accepted. If there is no community center, there may be
a women's hot line or women's center. Traditionally, these centers have been very helpful
in disseminating information about gay/lesbian organizations</p>

<p>Some radio stations and/or television stations in your area will accept PSA's (Public
Service Announcements). Some of these may even have a gay/lesbian radio program which will
happily list your chapter's activities as part of their local newscast. Usually they will
ask that you prepare a 10 or 30 second &quot;spot&quot; to be read over the air</p>

<p>Don't overlook the possibility of advertising in the local Catholic paper. Even though
the official Vatican line is firm, many diocesan justice and peace officers, ministries to
singles, or ministries to the &quot;spiritually alienated&quot; will be happy to help
publicize the fact that you exist and have regularly scheduled meetings and liturgies.
Even the religion editor of your local mainstream newspapers may want to talk to someone
from the chapter when some &quot;newsy&quot; catholic event is happening.</p>

<p>Finally, contact the owners and managers of businesses and organizations that cater to
the gay/lesbian community in your area. These organizations (bars, bookstores,
restaurants, clubs etc.) will usually be happy to let you place fliers or allow you to
post a notice on their bulletin boards. Usually you can promise a &quot;thank you&quot; to
the organization in your local newsletter as payment. Don't overlook these business
resources as potential sponsors for fund raising activities</p>

<p>Feel free to contact your Regional Coordinator or National Director for additional help
in finding sources for free advertising. The Director is eager to help you get your
chapter off to a good start, and will give you as much help as he or she can. It may be
possible for the Director to travel to your city to speak at rallies, meetings, or as a
guest on a local talk show.</p>
