<p></b></font><strong><font face="Arial" SIZE="5">W</font><font face="Arial">e believe
that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered Catholics in our diversity are members of
Christ's mystical body, numbered among the People of God. We have an inherent dignity
because God created us, Christ died for us, and the Holy Spirit sanctified us in Baptism,
making us temples of the Spirit, and channels through which God's love becomes visible.
Because of this, it is our right, our privilege, and our duty to live the sacramental life
of the Church, so that we might become more powerful instruments of God's love working
among all people. </font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>We believe that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered
persons can express their sexuality in a manner that is consonant with Christ's teaching.
We believe that we can express our sexuality physically, in a unitive manner that is
loving, life-giving, and life-affirming. We believe that all sexuality should be exercised
in an ethically responsible and unselfish way. </strong></font></p>
